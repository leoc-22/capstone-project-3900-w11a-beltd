# COMP3900 Work Diary

## Week 1
We created our group of 5 and set up Jira for the whole team. We also decided on the project that we wanted to work on and decided on a draft of the 8 functionalities that we wanted to implement. I will be the team scrum master and work on front end with Bob, Leo, Theo and Dolly will work on back end.

## Week 2
In our tutorial, we finalised our 8 functionalities and split the user stories and acceptance criteria between the team. At the end of the tutorial, we split up the different parts of the proposal between the team. I will be working on adding the user stories to Jira once they have all been finalised. I will also create the wireframes for our project using Figma. At the end of the week, Theo said that he will be dropping the course, so we redistributed tasks to Leo and Dolly.

## Week 3
I added in all of our user stories and acceptance criteria into Jira, organising them by epics and assigning them to each of the sprints. I added all the information about sprints and stories to our proposal document and I also created all the wireframes in Figma and added them to our group proposal. We had a meeting between the team to finalise all the information in the proposal and I submitted the document on Sunday night.

## Week 4 
We started working on sprint 1, splitting tasks between front end and back end. I worked on the front end for the sign up page, reset a password page and changing a password page. I was also sourcing the graphics for our website from openpeeps.com. I also made some edits to the login page to allow for the functionality of resetting a password. Our team is using Discord to communicate so that everybody can talk about the different areas that they are working on without cluttering a single chat.
