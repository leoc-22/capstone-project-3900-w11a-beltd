## 22T1 COMP3900 Work Diary

### Week 1

This week, we formed our groups and picked the book recommendation project. We chose Elicia as our scrum master and briefly outlined the tech stack we wanted to use. We decided that Elicia and Bob would work on the frontend and Leo, Theo and I would work on the backend. Finally we started a google doc and came up with our six basic functionalities and two novel functionalities.

### Week 2

This week, we split up the basic functionalities amongst the five of us and completed the user stories and acceptance criteria. I finished the US for account management. We also divvied up the rest of the proposal to complete by the lab next week. One of our members dropped the course, so we will also be shuffling some responsibilities around.

### Week 3

This week, I completed my sections of the proposal. I looked over all the US and AC and edited them where necessary. I also wrote up the background and comparison sections as well as the initial short project objectives. I also wrote up the user types section as well as all the referencing.

### Week 4

This week, we started on our sprints. Unfortunately I was not able to pull my weight due to a busy schedule outside of uni. Leo has been a big help and has sinked some of his time trying to help me pick up the slack and issues with my ticket as well. 

**What did I work on?**
Forget password via email functionality and started API ticket but didn't get very far at all (Leo covered for me here).

**What were the roadblocks?**
Busy schedule and poor time management on my part. Also quite inexperienced with what we're doing so tried to catch up a bit. Forget password ticket not merged into main due to issues with configuring OAuth for Gmail on Google Cloud Platform. Tried a few different solutions but none seem to work so far.

**What do I plan to do next sprint?**
Better manage time, start earlier so can afford to sink some time into learning new tools and how everything works.
