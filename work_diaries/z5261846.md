## Week 1

- Formed a group during the tutorial.
- Chose Elicia as the scrum master.
- Theo, Dolly, and I would be responsible for the backend and Elicia and Bob would be in charge of the frontend.
- We chose the book recommendation project as our project and decided that we would use react for the frontend, expressjs for the backend.
- Bob suggested to use either Firebase or MongoDB as the database storage tool.
- We created a doc to outline six basic functionalities and two novel functionalities.
- After lecture I researched the differences between MongoDB and Firebase and as a result they were very similar since they are both non-SQL database system. Since I was also studying COMP3311 this term I researched the pros and cons of using an SQL database system and a non-SQL database system.

## Week 2

- Finished the user stories and acceptance criteria. I ended up finishing the user stories and acceptance criteria for one of the novel functionalities and the search function.
- Allocate rest of the tasks for finishing the project proposal to each of us.
- I was doing the system architecture diagram and description.
- Before the week ended, Theo messaged us saying he was going to drop the course, so we each took some of his tasks for the proposal.
- I took on the novel functionality description task.

## Week 3

- Finished the architecture diagram and description and novel functionality description on time. Formatted the doc before we handed in.
- During the tutorial we eventually decided to use MongoDB since Bob was also familiar with it.
- At the end of the week, I registered a MongoDB account, created an orgnisation for this course and invited teammates to join.
- Read a few tutorial online about using MongoDB in the expressjs server.

## Week 4
