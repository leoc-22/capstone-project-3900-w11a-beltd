22T1 COMP3900 Work Diary

Week 1
This week, we formed our groups and picked the book recommendation project. 
We chose Elicia as our scrum master and briefly outlined the tech stack we 
wanted to use. We decided that Elicia and Bob would work on the frontend and 
Leo, Theo and I would work on the backend. Finally we started a google doc 
and came up with our six basic functionalities and two novel functionalities.

Week 2
This week, we split up the basic functionalities amongst the five of us and 
completed the user stories and acceptance criteria. I finished the US for
account management. We also divvied up the rest of the proposal to complete 
by the lab next week. One of our members dropped the course, so we will also 
be shuffling some responsibilities around. 

Week 3
This week, I completed my sections of the proposal. I looked over all the US
and AC and edited them where necessary. I also wrote up the background and 
comparison sections as well as the initial short project objectives. I also 
wrote up the user types section as well as all the referencing.
